These are the key files used for the ES 7018 project which I used for the write-up "ES 7018 - Geospatial Analysis of Forest Loss in PICOP (v2).docx".
Four files are too large to upload: T51PZK_20160721T021352_B04_10m.jp2, T51PZK_20160721T021352_B08_10m.jp2,T51PZK_20250902T021231_B04_10m.jp2,
and T51PZK_20250902T021231_B08_10m.jp2. 
As such, the RMD file may not be able to run.
